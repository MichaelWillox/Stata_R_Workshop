# Stata R Workshop

In May 2024, postgraduate researchers in the Economics and Finance Department at Brunel University London participated in a two-day workshop covering regression analysis, time series, panel data, and the generalized method of moments (GMM) using Stata and R.

Students were given exercises to assess their knowledge of Stata and R. This repository contains the answers to those exercises in both Stata and R.
